Checking my music library and adding album covers. Basic stuff

Files:
judgeAlbumCovers.py - Returns any albums that don't have a 500x500 cover
judgeBitrates.py - Returns any songs that don't have the preferred bitrate (320kb/s for mp3, 256kb/s for m4a)
addCover.py - Adds "cover.jpg" to an mp3 or m4a file if it's in the same directory
statsOnTags.py - Generalist file that returns number of files with certain mp3/m4a tags.
